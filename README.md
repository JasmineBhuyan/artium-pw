# Artium Academy – Playwright Automation Framework

A Python-based end-to-end test automation framework for [Artium Academy](https://uatreact.artiumacademy.com/) built with Playwright and pytest.

---

## Problem Statement

**URL:** https://uatreact.artiumacademy.com/

1. Log in to the Chrome browser.
2. Create a student using the "Book a Trial" button.
3. Execute the code and save screenshots once the execution is complete.
4. Commit the framework to GitHub.
5. Share the GitHub project URL.

## Objective

Automate the end-to-end "Book a Trial" student creation flow on the Artium Academy UAT environment, including form submission, OTP verification, and slot confirmation — with auto-generated screenshots and an HTML report at every step.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed before proceeding:

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Google Chrome browser

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd artium-pw
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install Playwright browser

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### 5. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
HEADLESS=true
SLOW_MO=800
```

> Set `HEADLESS=false` if you want to watch the browser during test execution.
